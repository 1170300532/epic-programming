# epic-programming v.0.0.1 ALPHA

##WELCOME##
Hi there!
Haven't you dreamed of make your Java code creation more EPIC?
I have.
I found there exists activate-power-mode for Atom (https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode), and also the same for IDEA or VisualStudio, but not for Eclipse.
So I have created one :) 
##


The Eclipse plug-in is still in development but present version 0.0.1 is stable.
Plug-in is associated with Java files, but still needs to use "Open With" option from context menu. 




##INSTALLATION
To install plugin extract plugin.zip and copy *.jar file into /eclipse/dropins.
After (re)start of Eclipse plugin should work.
For detailed information go to WIKI page.
